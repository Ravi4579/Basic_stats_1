# Sales & Discounts Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves performing descriptive analytics, visualizing data distributions, and preprocessing a sales and discounts dataset for further analysis. The key objectives include deriving insights from the data and preparing it for machine learning models.

## Objectives
1. **Descriptive Analytics:** Compute basic statistical measures for numerical columns.
2. **Data Visualization:** Analyze and visualize the distribution and relationships of variables.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardize numerical variables and convert categorical data into dummy variables.

## Project Steps

### 1. Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns
- **Goal:** Analyze basic statistical measures to understand the data.
- **Steps:**
  - Loaded the dataset using Python and the Pandas library.
  - Identified numerical columns in the dataset.
  - Calculated the following for each numerical column:
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode
    - Standard Deviation
  - Provided interpretations of these statistics to summarize data trends.

### 2. Data Visualization
#### Histograms
- Plotted histograms for each numerical column.
- Analyzed the distribution for skewness, outliers, and patterns.

#### Boxplots
- Created boxplots for numerical columns to:
  - Identify outliers.
  - Understand the interquartile range.
- Documented findings on unusual distributions or extreme values.

#### Bar Chart Analysis
- Identified categorical columns in the dataset.
- Created bar charts to visualize the frequency of categories.
- Provided insights into category distributions.

### 3. Standardization of Numerical Variables
- **Objective:** Scale numerical variables for uniformity using z-score normalization.
- Formula used: \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \)
- Compared distributions before and after standardization to illustrate the effect.

### 4. Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
- **Objective:** Transform categorical variables into a machine-learning-friendly format.
- **Steps:**
  - Explained the need for one-hot encoding.
  - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns, generating binary columns for each category.
  - Displayed a sample of the transformed dataset.

## Key Findings
- Descriptive analytics revealed key trends and characteristics of the numerical data.
- Visualizations highlighted distribution patterns, outliers, and categorical data frequencies.
- Standardization improved data uniformity, making it ready for advanced modeling.
- One-hot encoding effectively transformed categorical variables, enabling their use in machine learning algorithms.

## Importance of Data Preprocessing
- Standardization ensures that numerical variables are on the same scale, critical for algorithms sensitive to magnitude differences.
- One-hot encoding converts categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models, enabling them to process categorical information effectively.
